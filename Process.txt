1.First setup the chromadb cloud client.

2.Take all the data that you want to add in in your Memory.

3.Do preprocessing step at that data like Split the data into Chunks.

4.Create a class for doing embeddings and make function inside it to do actual emeding from documents
 or Chunks.Embeddings function is a class that takes a model name , text to embed as content
 task type and returns embeddings for the given input.
(Function used genai.embed_content)
4.Create a class Object and process the actual embeddings.

5.Create a collection by function (get_or_creaete_collection) in Chromadb and Add the embeddings in the collection by(collection.add(ids,)).
 Specify the embeding function here while putting data into Collection.

6.Now you can query the data from the collection Using function (collection.query(pass embeded query here with n_results parameter ))

7.Thes task type parameter is used to specify the type of task for which the embeddings are being generated. In this case, "retrieval_query" 
is used to indicate that the embeddings are being generated for a query that will be used for retrieval purposes. 
This can help the embedding model to generate embeddings that are optimized for retrieval tasks, such as finding similar
documents or items.
