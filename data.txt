1. Pratik Kohli woke up before sunrise today, determined to finally finish that machine learning project.

2. “Coffee first, then code,” he muttered, opening his laptop with a sleepy grin.

3. The gentle hum of rain outside made the morning feel slower, but somehow, more peaceful.

4. Pratik’s friends still tease him about that one time he brought a drone to college just to deliver snacks.

5. His favorite playlist? A mix of lofi beats and old Bollywood tracks—chaotic but strangely perfect.

6. “If I can’t fix it with Python, I’ll just automate it with Python,” he joked while debugging.

7. The walls of his room are covered with sticky notes—half ideas, half reminders.

8. Sometimes, Pratik imagines living in the mountains, coding while watching clouds roll by.

9. The new Raspberry Pi project is coming along nicely—he plans to make a smart photo frame next.

10. He keeps a journal full of small wins: “Deployed my first AI model today. It worked!”

11. Pratik once said his dream job is one where he can build, break, and rebuild things every day.

12. He has a soft spot for photography; every weekend, he wanders out just to capture sunsets.

13. “A perfect line of code feels like a perfect photograph,” he told his classmate once.

14. Even when things go wrong, he shrugs, smiles, and says, “Just another bug in the story.”

15. Tonight, Pratik Kohli closed his laptop at 2 AM—tired but proud.
